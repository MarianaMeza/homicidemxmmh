The following graphs tell the story of the Mexican security crisis that began after the launch of the War on Drugs in December 2006.
The first graph "Homicides.pdf" Shows the total homicides by firearm by month and year. The graph shows how after the start of the War on Drugs violent homicide skyrocketed and have not receded.
The second graph "Cause.pdf" shows how men and women are killed in Mexico. As one may suspect, the highes proportion of homicides both for men and women is by unspecified fireram. However the interesting difference relies in the fact that a higher proportion of women are killed by asphyxiation, knife and unspecified means. This is interesting because it points toward the "feminicide" problem in Mexico where women are killed because of being women. In contrast, men are killed by firearms which relates more to the crime related to organized crime and drug war.
The third graph "Corruption.pdf" shows a positive relationship between the percent of the populaton who say state attorneys are corrupt and the total number of reported crimes. Surprisingly, there is a positive relationship that means tho states with a higher perception of corruption are also the ones with more reported crimes. The graph controls by the size of the rate of crimes per 100,000. The larger the rate of cimes the larger the dots. The red dots show the states that are "outliers" or that show an untrend behavior.
